# Travel Application Website Overview
   ## Live Project [*(link to live project)*](https://traval-app.herokuapp.com/)

   ## Project Introduction
   (**Note:** this is a fictitious client generated for the purpose of developing this project to test my HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript and Django Framework essentials.)

   This website has been designed to provide users with an easy to use web application to aide in the planning and tacking of travel. The primary objectives of this project are to develop a diary for users to log their travel/holiday experiences whilst also allowing them to mark visited and wish list countries on a map. In addition to these key deliverables the client would also like to provide users with basic country info and an easy to to use travel task manager.

   Following discussions with the client this site will initially be tailored to Europe with the potential to expend the available countries following initial go live. There will also be future opertunities to provide a public blog for users to share their experiences with a wider audience however this is not in scope for the initial launch.

   The client requesting this website is using this as the first step in creating a one stop location for planning and booking holiday and transport needs. The initial goal is to generate user traffic and link in with potential future partners such as booking.com, sectret escapes, kuoni travel, skyscanner to provide a booking platform on a commision based model.

   ## Website Design

  <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Colour Scheme</summary>

   <br>
   Client requested the site to be built from shades of grey with a bold blue for emphasising key elements. This consideration was made to not pull focus or negativly impact the readability of the site due to its information nature.<br>

   - Main colours: 
      - #064467 (Dark Blue)
      - #cacaca (Light Grey)
      - #484848 (Dark Grey)
      - #e9e4e4 (Off White)
      - #ffffff (White)

   In additon to the standard colour scheme delete buttons will be marked as red to indicate the risk assosiated with them:

   - Delete colour:
      - #e2110a (Red)

   ---
   </details>

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Select Letters</summary>
   <br>

   #### Letters selected are checked against word

   </details>

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Settings</summary>
   <br>

   #### Settings held on index page
   The settings content will be kept on the same page at the rest of the web content. This is to ensure the score is retained as backend data storage is not in use for this project.

   A scroll feature was added to the settings to post-it to keep the sizing consistent. This will only appear if required on small screens.

   ![Start of game](assets/readme-assets/features/settings/settings.png)
   <br>

   ---

   ![Start of game](assets/readme-assets/features/score/increase-score.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Score decrease
   If the user does not guess the word in 10 attempts, then their score will reduce by 5 points. This has the potential to take the users overall score into a negative figure.

   ![Start of game](assets/readme-assets/features/score/lose-5-points.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Score accumulation
   If the user opts to play again their score will be retained from the previous games with the new score being added.

   Following the HTML validation, the following warnings were identified and addressed.

   ![HTML Warnings](assets/readme-assets/bugs/html/html-warinings.png)

   ---

   #### **Resolutions**
   **Points 1 - 2:**
   These were initially implemented as li items acting as a menu option directing to additional content. However, removed aria-label following best practice due to no href.

   ---

   **Points 3 - 7:**
   All ID first occurrences were addressed by changing duplicate IDs to classes.

   ---

   **Points 8:**
   Placed empty quotes into h2 space to remove error. This header is produced by JS.

   ---

   ### Errors
   Following the HTML validation, the following errors were identified and addressed.

   ![HTML Warnings](assets/readme-assets/bugs/html/html-errors.png)

   ---

   #### **Resolutions**
   **Point 1:**
   Delete stray div tag.

   ---

   **Points 2 - 6:**
   - Replace IDs with Classes and update CSS to .element as opposed to #element.
   - Checked ID was not used in JS.
   - Removed duplicate class syntax e.g. class="settings-pin" class="pin-right". This was changed to class=”settings-pin pin-right”.

   ---

   **Points 7 - 10:**
   Mute is defaulted as true so no need to specify. Therefore removed = “true”.

   On refreshing the page a warning was highlighted on the console log. I used Stack Overflow to investigate the potential impact of this warning.

   Stack Overflow findings:

      Basically you can ignore it. GitHub hosted pages disable FLoC, which is Google's 3rd party cookie alternative. GitHub, Microsoft, doesn't seems to like it.

   Following this review and consultation with my mentor no action was required for this warning.

   ## Development Bugs

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Menu Toggle Issue</summary>
   
   On closing settings or rules using the close button on a small screen the menu remains open. I want this to close to improve aesthetics and reduce required button clicks when returning to game.

   ![Leave Settings Img](assets/readme-assets/bugs/develoment/leave-settings.png)

   ![Leave Settings Img](assets/readme-assets/bugs/develoment/small-menu.png)

   Image shows that after ‘Leave Settings’ is selected the menu remains on screen until the ? icon is selected again.

   Another issue this caused was that if the rules or settings content were opened on a small screen and the ? icon was clicked it would toggle the menu off and need to be clicked again to open the menu options.

   The final issue with the toggle option on the ? icon was that when it was set to on and the screen size was changed to large, when rules or settings were opened and the screen was returned to small the menu overlapped the rules or settings content.

   ![Leave Settings Img](assets/readme-assets/bugs/develoment/overlap-menu.png)

   Image shows the menu overlapping rules and settings content.

   By adding the matchMedia code and moving the rules and settings in front of the small screen menu with a CSS z-index of 2 the functionality works as intended.
   
   <br>

   **Code block to resolve:**

      if (matchMedia("(min-width: 821px)").matches) {
            postIt.className = "post-it-contents";
      }
      else {
            postIt.classList.toggle("select");
      }

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Canvas Re-Size</summary>
   
   When I initially drew the hangman on the canvas, I had an issue if the screen was re-sized. The image would not re-size along with it.

   By implementing an event listener for window re-size and calculating the canvas images based on a percentage of the canvas height and width I was able to resolve this issue.

   ![Leave Settings Img](assets/readme-assets/bugs/develoment/hangman-resize.png)

   Image shows canvas not re-sizing to match screen change.
  
   <br>

   **Code block to resolve:**

      window.addEventListener("resize", function() {
        canvas.width = canvasSize.clientWidth;
        canvas.height = canvasSize.clientHeight;
        hangmanDraw();
      });

   The above code block shows how when the screen size is changed the canvas re-sizes and redraws the required elements.

      function drawBase() {
        ctx.fillRect(canvas.width * 0.2, canvas.height * 0.9, canvas.width * 0.6, 5);
      }
   
   The above code block shows a canvas element calculated based on canvas dimensions.

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Underscore Overlap</summary>
   
   When testing the game, it was identified that for long words the underscores overlapped the word output container.

   ![Leave Settings Img](assets/readme-assets/bugs/develoment/underscores-overlap.jpg)

   However, when some of the letters were presented as text it did not.

   ![Leave Settings Img](assets/readme-assets/bugs/develoment/word-fits.jpg)

   I identified that this was because in the JS code I had put spaces around the underscores. However, I had also set the CSS word output to have a letter spacing of 0.8rem.
  
   <br>

   **Code blocks detailing issue:**

   JS code:

      function underscoreWord() {
         for (let i = 0; i < selectedWord.length; i++) { 
            shownWord[i] = " _ "; //remove spaces from around the underscore
            }
        
            wordOutput.innerHTML = shownWord.join(" ");
         }
   
   CSS code:

      #word-output {
         height: 54px;
         display: flex;
         justify-content: center;
         align-items: center;
         font-size: 2rem;
         font-weight: bold;
         letter-spacing: .8rem; // already has spacing between letters
         background-color: white;
         border: 2px solid black;
         border-radius: 1.2rem;
         margin-bottom: 27px;
      }

   By removing the spacing from the underscore in the JS code, it resolved the issue. 

   Despite this I later decided to make the maximum word length 6 letters. This was because when the text size was reduced to fit the output container for a small screen it was becoming challenging to read the letters.

   In future developments the word output container could be increased to allow for longer words and potentially sentences.

   ## Key Learn
   The main key learn I took from this project was to build the readme file in conjunction with the website development.

   I was not sure if the design and functionality were feasible for the development of this project given my limited experience in CSS and JS. Therefore, I spent a lot of time building it in a test environment before deciding I could accomplish the desired result.

   By the time I had realised it was feasible I had completed a lot of the work. As a result of this I had to retrospectively complete sections of the readme file which would have been better suited to completing at the scoping, researching and initial build stages.

   Despite this I feel that I did a good job recording my progress through easy-to-understand concise commits which made it easier to revisit certain elements of the project where necessary.

# Deployment
   ## Set Up Local GitHub Repository
   1. Go to https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template.
   2. Select use this template.
   3. Add repository name within my GitHub. (This will generate a repository in my Git Hub with the appropriate files.)


   ## Repository Framework
   1. Select the repository on GitHub and open with GitPod (green button).
   2. Create required html page.
   3. Create assets folder.
   4. Within assets folder create CSS folder, images folder, JS folder & readme-assets folder.
   5. Add required files to folders including style.css, images, script.js, etc.


   ## Update Repository
   1. When adding a new feature create a separate branch to work in safely typing into the terminal "git branch 'name of required feature/update'".
   2. Checkout the branch with "git checkout 'name of required feature/update'".
   3. Make updates and test using "python -m http.server".
   4. Once testing is complete add to Git staging area using "git add ."
   5. Commit the changes and add a useful explanation of what action was done to track the history in GitHub using "git commit -m 'explanation of update'".
   6. Once the feature is complete, fully tested, and ready to be added to the main branch first go to the main branch using "git checkout main".
   7. Merge the feature branch into the main using "git merge 'name of required feature/update'".
   8. Confirm merge was successful and then if it is not going to be re-used delete the feature branch using "git branch -d 'name of required feature/update'". (If deleting a branch with commits not merged to main delete with -D instead of -d)
   9. Use "git push" to push the commits to GitHub. These will then appear in the live website if it has been set up in GitHub Pages.


   ## GitHub Pages
   Deploy in GitHub Pages:
   1. Log in to my GitHub and go to my appropriate repository.
   2. Access settings.
   3. Under 'Code and Automation' go to pages.
   4. Leave the source as Deploy from Branch.
   5. Set Branch to Main.
   6. Save.
   7. Give GitHub a few minutes and the live URL is provided at the top of the GutHub Pages section of settings.
   8. Any Git Pushes from the terminal whilst working on the repository using GitPod will now update in this live site.
