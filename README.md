# Travel Application Website Overview
   ## Live Project [*(link to live project)*](https://traval-app.herokuapp.com/)

   ## Project Introduction
   (**Note:** this is a fictitious client generated for the purpose of developing this project to test my HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript and Django Framework essentials.)

   This website has been designed to provide users with an easy to use web application to aide in the planning and tracking of travel. The primary objectives of this project are to develop a diary for users to log their travel/holiday experiences whilst also allowing them to mark visited and wish list countries on a map. In addition to these key deliverables the client would also like to provide users with basic country info and an easy to to use travel task manager.

   Following discussions with the client this site will initially be tailored to Europe with the potential to expand the available countries following initial go live. There will also be future opertunities to provide a public blog for users to share their experiences with a wider audience however this is not in scope for the initial launch.

   The client requesting this website is using this as the first step in creating a one stop location for planning and booking holiday and transport needs. The initial goal is to generate user traffic and link in with potential future partners such as Booking.com, Secret Escapes, Kuoni Travel, Skyscanner to provide a booking platform on a commision based model.

   ## Website Design

  <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Colour Scheme</summary>

   <br>
   Client requested the site to be built from shades of grey with a bold blue for emphasising key elements. This consideration was made to not pull focus or negatively impact the readability of the site due to its information nature.<br>

   - Main colours: 
      - #064467 (Dark Blue)
      - #cacaca (Light Grey)
      - #484848 (Dark Grey)
      - #e9e4e4 (Off White)
      - #ffffff (White)

   In additon to the standard colour scheme delete buttons will be marked as red to indicate the risk assosiated with them:

   - Delete colour:
      - #e2110a (Red)

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Agile Methodology</summary>
   <br>

   An Agile methodology was applied to the development and implementation of this project.

   The project development was run in multiple iterations/sprints each targeting a number of User Stories.

   Each User Story was moved out of a backlog and assigned to the iteration with a priority label (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have).
   In addition to User Stories, bugs and enhancments were also applied within certain iterations.

   To manage the Agile iterations I used the projects function within my GitHub account, pulling User Stories into a KanBan Board. (Links to each project iteration detailed in the iteration breakdown below.)

   **Note:** It should be noted that the priority label was in relation to it's prioriry within the iteration, not the project as a whole.

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Iteration 1</summary>
   <br>

   For Iteration 1 the key focus was to target the Site Administration to ensure the platform was operational with a superuser. Test users were set up with the ability to login and out as well as reset passwords.

   In additon to this some optional site update User Stories where applied to allow the site owner to detail updates to test users as the site was in development.

   For site of the project in GitHub detailing the completed User Stories in Iteration 1 please click [here](https://github.com/users/Joe-Collins-1986/projects/2/views/1).

   <br>

   </details>

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Iteration 2</summary>
   <br>

   For Iteration 2 the key focus was to target the country navigation which would provide the platform to later add diary posts and a task manager.

   In additon to this some more optional site update User Stories where applied to allow test users to comment on the updates posted by the site owner.

   For site of the project in GitHub detailing the completed User Stories in Iteration 2 please click [here](https://github.com/users/Joe-Collins-1986/projects/3/views/1).

   </details>

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Iteration 3</summary>
   <br>

   Due to other commitments I was unable to conduct a standard iteration.
   
   Therefore, this iteration was used to review existing features and update them with user feedback. It was also used to finalise the site update features which will allow a tracker of future feature development and allow test users a way of feeding back their findings.

   </details>

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Iteration 4</summary>
   <br>

   For Iteration 4 the key focus was to target the site Diary functionality which would allow users to post, update and delete diary entries related to a specific country.

   In additon to this some optional profile User Stories where applied to auto generate a profile when a user is set up and allow users to update their profile info where required.

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Iteration 5</summary>
   <br>

   For Iteration 5 the key focus was to target the To-Do List functionality which would allow users create, update and delete lists as well as assigning tasks to the lists and toggling them from open to closed or deleteing them where required.

   ### **Features breakdown**

   Each section below will detail their specific function.
   

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Navbar/Footer Features</summary>
   <br>

   #### NavBar
   The Navbar has been fixed to allow the user easy access to all key pages. (Some pages are not accessible via the nav bar as they are dependent on selections made via other pages e.g. country info).

   Prior to login the user will see the following Navbar:
   ![Navbar Not Logged In](readme-assets/features/nav-bar/nav-bar-lg-no-login.png)<br>

   **Note:** Despite seeing the planner the user will not be able to access it until logged in. This was an intentional decision to show non registered users features they could not access to drive curiosity and engourage registration.

   After login the user will see the following Navbar:
   ![Navbar Logged In](readme-assets/features/nav-bar/nav-bar-lg-login.png)<br>
   
   If the user is using a mobile screen they will have an expandable nav menu:<br>
   ![Navbar Mobile](readme-assets/features/nav-bar/nav-bar-sm-login.png)<br>

   **Note:** This menu will show the same options to the user, depending on their logged in status, as that of the large screen nav bar.

   #### Footer

         <summary style="font-weight:bold">Account Management Features</summary>
   <br>
   
   #### Register
   New Users will have the option to Register an account. This page can be accessed either via the Navbar menu or by selecting the Sign Up option presented on the Login page when users first access the site (this link will be shown on the Login feature).

   On valid Registration the user will be taken straight to the home page without having to re-login.

   ![Register Page](readme-assets/features/register/register.png)
   <br>

   Django validation checks will be carried out on the registration form as with all future forms referenced in this Readme file.

   ![Register Form Validation 1](readme-assets/features/register/form-validation.png)
   <br>
   ![Register Form Validation 2](readme-assets/features/register/form-wrong-password.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Login
   If the user has a registered account they will be able to login to the site using the login page.

   This page will also offer links to sign up and password reset. The password reset function will be covered below.

   ![Login Page](readme-assets/features/login/login.png)
   <br>

   If the user tries to access site areas where login is required they will be directed to the following login page.

   ![Login Access Required Page](readme-assets/features/login/access-login-required.png)
   <br>

   After completing the login they will automatically be redirected to the page they were initially trying to access.

   ![Login Redirect](readme-assets/features/login/login-redirect.png)
   <br>

   As with registration Djago will manage the standard form validation.

   ![Login Access Required Page](readme-assets/features/login/login-form-validation.png)
   <br>
   
   ---

   #### Password Reset
   The user will be given the opportunity to reset their password in case they forget it or want to change it for security purposes. The link to resetting the password is found on the login page.

   On this page the user will be asked to enter their email to initiate the process. Standard Django form validation is used for confirming the email.

   ![Password Reset](readme-assets/features/password-reset/password-reset.png)
   <br>

   Once a valid email is input the user will get a confirmation that an email has been sent.

   ![Password Email Sent](readme-assets/features/password-reset/email-sent.png)
   <br>

   The user will then receive an email taking them to a password reset form.

   ![Password Email Recieved](readme-assets/features/password-reset/email.png)
   <br>

   After following the email link the user will be asked to input a password and confirm it. This password will have a Django password validation applied to it to ensure it is secure enough to use.

   ![Password Reset Form](readme-assets/features/password-reset/new-password-page.png)
   <br>

   Following a successful password reset the user will recieve the following confirmation page.

   ![Password Reset Confirmation](readme-assets/features/password-reset/password-updated.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Logout
   The user can logout of the site by simply selecting the logout option on the Navbar menu.
   
   ---

   #### Summary Site Updates
   The client wanted users to be able to see a summary of the most recent site updates at a glance and didn't want this to be restricted to signed in users. The logic for this is that the site updates and site news articles could be a good way of incentivising new users to register.

   To this end, the 3 most recent site update posts are always presented at the bottom of the Login, Register, Password Reset and Home pages.

   Non logged in users can also select the 'see all updates' button to be taken to a page with all the site updates. However only signed in users will be able to navigate to any one specific site update in order to place comments.

   ![Site_Updates Summary](readme-assets/features/site-updates-summary/3-site-updates.png)
   <br>
   
   ---

   </details>

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Home Features</summary>
   <br>

   #### Parallax Home Screen
   To create an engaging initial introduction to the site a Parallax effect was applied to the home page image. However to meet the asthetic requirements of the client this meant removing the inner scroll bar. As a result a downward facing arrow was applied to the screen to direct users to scroll down incase it was not immediately apparent. This arrow was given some simple JS flashing animation to make the page more interesting.
   <br>

   ![Home Parallax](readme-assets/features/home/home.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Home Planner Introduction
   Further down the home page there is a little introduction to some of the features the site offers as part of the planner.

   ![Home Planner Introduction](readme-assets/features/home/home-planner.png)
   <br>

   </details>

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Profile Features</summary>
   <br>

   #### Create Profile
   On registration a skeleton profile will be automatically generated for each user. 

   ![Skeleton Profile](readme-assets/features/profile/skeleton-profile.png)
   <br>

   ---
   
   #### Profile Page
   This page will allow users to view their site details as well as give them an opportunity to note down any travel objectives they may have.

   In addition to this if the user has recorded any countries they wish to visit on the planner then links to these country info pages will be available to the user via their profile page.

   ![Profile Page](readme-assets/features/profile/profile.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Update Profile
   Users will be able to update their details and travel objectives via the update Profile page.

   They can also add an avatar or photo of themselves and update the Profile page background from a list of potential options.

   ![Update Profile Page](readme-assets/features/profile/update-profile.png)
   <br>

   ---

   </details>

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Planner Features</summary>
   <br>

   #### Map Country Selection
   From the map on the planner page the user can navigate to a country info page relating to that country. From here the user will be able to access a number of other application features which will be detailed below. One of these features will enable the user to mark the country to visited or wish list. Having done this the map will be updated to reflect the wish list and visited countries in different colours.

   ![Country Selection Map](readme-assets/features/planner/map.png)
   <br>

   **Note:** The SVG used to show this map was taken from https://simplemaps.com/resources/svg-world and then tailored to the clients requirements. The client agreed that initial roll out should be tailored to Europe rather than the world.

   ---

   #### Map Country Hover
   Due to the size of the map it was not aesthetically pleasing to add names to each country via the svg file. However, the client wanted to ensure that users could locate the countries they were looking for and therefore JS was used to add a hover function to the map which would should the country name that the mouse is over. This country name can be seen in the top right corner.
   <br>

   ---

   #### Dropdown Country Selection
   Due to the fact that many people using this site would be on mobile devices or tablets and would not have hover functionality available to them the client also requested that a dropdown be added in alphabetical order so that users can select the country that way if they wish.

   In additon to this if a user has a country marked as 'wish list' or 'visited' additional dropdown fields will appear.
   <br>

   ---

   #### Pie Chart
   To provide an easy to see visually appealing method of displaying how many countries the user has visited and wishes to visit npm Chart.js was used to present the information in a pie chart.

   However, on a small screen test users indicated that this was distracting them from the key focus of the page(navigation) and therefore this is only visible on large screen sizes.

   ![Pie Chart Hidden](readme-assets/features/planner/map-small.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Legend
   A Bootstrap Modal was used and tailored to the requirement of displaying a legend for mobile devices so as not to take up space from the map.

   ![Legend Small Screen](readme-assets/features/planner/map-small-legend.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Country Info Header
   To create a interesting and aesthetically pleasing country info page an image (taken from unsplash) and a flag (taken from https://www.iconfinder.com/flag-icons?price=free) was added to each country object.

   This was then called dependant on the country pk that was used in the url.

   A Back to Map icon was also added. Following user testing the concenses was that the image was intuative enough not to require text, this was also acceptable due to the fact that a user could also select Planner from the Navbar to return to the map.

   ![Country Info Header](readme-assets/features/planner/country-info-header.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Country Info
   To initially set up the countries with basic information a json was obtained from https://gist.github.com/keeguon/2310008?permalink_comment_id=4255990#gistcomment-4255990.

   From here unwanted data/countries were removed and any required additional fields were added. This was then looped through to generate all the required country objects.

   ![Country Info](readme-assets/features/planner/country-info-info.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Country Visited
   Users can mark the countries they have visited or countries they wish to visit via the form on the Country Info page.

   As stated in the map section above this will update the svg map to show the visited and wish list countries. In addition to this any wish list countries will also appear in the users profile page.

   ![Country Visited](readme-assets/features/planner/country-info-visited.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### To-Do Lists
   Users can use this feature to create, update or delete task lists. These lists are not the tasks themselves but rather a list of tasks that the user can add.

   ![To-Do Lists](readme-assets/features/planner/country-info-lists.png)
   <br>
   ![To-Do Lists Add](readme-assets/features/planner/create-list.png)
   <br>
   ![To-Do Lists Update](readme-assets/features/planner/update-list.png)
   <br>

   After discussions with the client and test users it was decided that the delete function would not require confirmation due to the simplicity of the lists. Therefore it deletes the list immediatly on selection.

   To access the list itself to add and manage task items the user can select the list anchor. This will be detailed in the task manager feature section. 

   ---

   #### Diary Link
   Users can access their personal diaries related to the country they are on via the diary link available.

   ![Diary Link](readme-assets/features/planner/country-info-diary.png)
   <br>

   ---

   </details>

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Task Manager Features</summary>
   <br>

   #### Add Tasks
   Users can create tasks within the selected list via the form available to them.

   ![Add Tasks](readme-assets/features/task-manager/tasks-added.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Close Tasks
   Once tasks have been completed users can mark them as closed. These will change colour and move them below the open tasks.

   ![Close Tasks](readme-assets/features/task-manager/closed-tasks.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Delete Tasks
   If a user wishes they can delete a task entirely. As with the lists the test users and client opted for no confirmation for this deletion.

   ![Delete Tasks](readme-assets/features/task-manager/delete-tasks.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Re-open Tasks
   Users will have the ability to re-open closed tasks if they wish. These tasks will return to their original styling and position on the list.

   ![Re-open Tasks](readme-assets/features/task-manager/tasks-re-opened.png)
   <br>

   ---

   </details>

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Diary Features</summary>
   <br>

   #### Add Diary Post
   Once users have navigated to their specific country diary they will be able to add diary posts via the 'Add Diary Post' button.

   ![Diary Page](readme-assets/features/diary/diary.png)

   Each post will allow the user to enter:
   
   - Content: Detailing their travel experiences
   - Image: This is an optional field the user can input if they wish. The image will be resized and stored to the client/site owner's AWS account.
   - Tags: The user can add multiple tags to a post if they wish which can later be used to help filter searches. If no Tag is added a 'NO TAGS' tag will be applied automatically. The user does not have to be case sensitive with the tag enteries as these are all converted to uppercase.
   - Experience: The user can select from a range of experience options. These will display on the post as emojis and can be selected to filter posts to that experience rating. This field is not manadatory and can be left 'Not Rated'.

   ![Add Diary Post](readme-assets/features/diary/add-diary.png)

   ---

   #### Update Diary Post
   If the user wishes to amend a post they have made they can select the update diary option.

   **Note:** The diary post date will not be effected by this update. Due to the nature of a diary it is more critical to show the date of post over the amendment date.

   ![Update Diary Post](readme-assets/features/diary/update-diary.png)

   ---

   #### Delete Diary Post
   If the user wishes to delete a post they are not happy with they can select delete. Unlike the Task Manager this will required a delete confirmation as more detail is added to diary posts and therefore the impact of accidental deletion is higher.

   ![Delete Diary Post](readme-assets/features/diary/delete-diary.png)

   ---

   #### Pagination
   Pagination is set to only show 2 posts per page. This was experimented with test users and they felt this was a good amount per page due to the large amount of content that cound be added to each post.

   ![Diary Pagination](readme-assets/features/diary/diary-pagination.png)

   ---

   #### Filter
   Users will be able to filter the posts they wish to see using a range of options.

   They can type into the search bar and it will return any posts where the content or tags include what they have typed.

   ![Diary Filter](readme-assets/features/diary/diary-search.png)

   The user can select the tags on the post itself to filter to the tag they have selected. Or they can navigate to the tag page via the 'Search Tags' button. This will list out all the tags that have been created and list them in order of their populatity. These can be selected and it will filter the posts to the tag selected.

   ![Tags Page](readme-assets/features/diary/tags-page.png)

   The user can select the experience emoji on the post itself to filter to the experience they have selected.

   ![Experience Filter](readme-assets/features/diary/diary-exp.png)

   The user can refresh the page to remove all filtering via the refresh page button next to the search posts field.

   **Note:** The pagination has been built to work on the filtered searches. Therefore, if there are more than 2 returned posts pagination will be applied.

   ---

   </details>

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Site Update Features</summary>
   <br>

   #### Site Updates Header
   When the user navigates to the site updates page the header will return the total number of posts added.

   ![Site Updates Page](readme-assets/features/site-updates/updates-page.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Site Update Posts
   The posts detailed on this screen are added by the site administrator. Users will not be able to add, update or delete any of these posts. However, logged in users will be able to select the post and add comments if they wish. This will be detailed later in this document.

   The number of comments users have added to a post is shown at the bottom of the post next to a little comment icon.

   ![Site Update Post](readme-assets/features/site-updates/site-update-post.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Site Updates Pagination
   Pagination is set to only show 5 posts per page. This was experimented with test users and they felt this was a good amount per page.

   ![Site Updates Pagination](readme-assets/features/site-updates/pagination.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Site Updates Filter
   The site update posts can be filtered using 2 different methods.

   The user can type a string into the search field and the page will return any posts where the title, content or topic contains that string. 

   ![Site Updates Seach Bar](readme-assets/features/site-updates/filter-bar-closed.png)
   <br>

   The user can also open the filter tab built with JS to show all the topics with the number of posts assigned to each and select these to filter the posts.

   ![Site Updates Filter Topic](readme-assets/features/site-updates/filter-bar-open.png)
   <br>

   **Note:** The pagination has been built to work on the filterd searches. Therefore, if there are more than 5 returned posts pagination will be applied.

   ---

   #### Add Comment To Post
   Once a logged in user selects a post they will be directed to a page where they can add comments and view other user comments related to that post.

   On a large screen the add comment form is directly on the page. This allows users to enter a title, comment and optionally an image.

   ![Site Update Large Screen](readme-assets/features/site-updates/site-post-page-lg.png)
   <br>

   If the user is using a small screen they can access the add comment form via the 'Add Comment' button.

   ![Site Update Small Screen](readme-assets/features/site-updates/site-post-page-sm.png)
   <br>

   ![Site Update Form](readme-assets/features/site-updates/add-comment.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Comment Linked To User
   If a user views a comment that has been added by another user thay will not be able to update or delete it and the update and delete buttons will not appear on the comment for them.

   ![Comment By Other User](readme-assets/features/site-updates/comment.png)
   <br>

   However, if they are the comment owner the update and delete buttons are available.

   ![Comment By User](readme-assets/features/site-updates/comment-update-delete.png)
   <br>

   !**Note:** Once a comment has been added the administrator has the ability to respond to it. This is so that if actions are required based on the comment the administrator can update the site users.

   ---

   #### Update Comment
   If a user wishes they can update their own comments. This will add an updated field to the comment to show when it was last amended.

   ![Update Comment](readme-assets/features/site-updates/update-comment.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Delete Comment
   If a user wishes they can delete their own comments. This will take them to a confirmation page to check they do not delete comments in error.

   ![Delete Comment](readme-assets/features/site-updates/comment-delete.png)

   Users will be provided with tailored pages when they experience errors.

   Page not found:

   ![404](readme-assets/features/error-pages/404.png)
   <br>

   Page not permitted:

   ![403](readme-assets/features/error-pages/403.png)

   <details>
      <summary style="font-weight:bold">Admin</summary>
   <br>

   #### Admin Navbar
   If an Superuser logs in to the site they will be shown an additional option on the navbar directing them to the Django administration area.

   ![Admin Navbar Large Screen](readme-assets/features/admin/admin-nav-large.png)
   <br>

   ![Admin Navbar Small Screen](readme-assets/features/admin/admin-nav-small.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Admin Models
   As part of the build for this project it has been useful to have access to all the models in the Admin section of the site. Following the clients approval most of these models will be removed leaving only the Site Update models and the Profile model.

   These will be used by admin to add site update posts, add new or remove post categories and respond to user comments. The Profile will also allow the administrators to aide users regarding their site details once an appropriate Identification and Verifiication process is agreed. 

   ![Admin Models](readme-assets/features/admin/show-all-admin-models.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Admin Posts
   Admin will be given the task of posting about site updates and news. This will be completed directly from the administaton area.

   ![Admin Posts](readme-assets/features/admin/admin-posts.png)
   <br>

   Summernote was installed to give the admin team more flexibility in how they posted the site updates and the specific fonts were added to the Summernote config. However, on review it was agreed that it would be more consistent to use standard inputs and formatthem using HTML and CSS via the templates.

   As a result Summernote was removed from the admin.py files, settings and requirements.txt.

   ---

   #### Admin Post Categories
   Each site update post will be assigned a category to help users filter results. The admin team will have the ability to add and remove categories if required.

   ![Admin Post Categories](readme-assets/features/admin/post-catagories.png)
   <br>

   ---

   #### Admin Comment Responses
   When a user comments on an update it will assign the object a Comment Status of Review Required. This will allow the admin team to filter any comments made by the user and mark them to Reviewed once they have looked them over. These can then be filtered out on future reviews.

   To this end a filter has been applied to the 'Comment Status'.

   ![Admin Filter Comments](readme-assets/features/admin/comments-filtered.png)
   <br>

   When an administrator reviews the comment they will have the ability to respond to it. This will them appear in the comment for all to see.

   ![Admin Comment Response](readme-assets/features/admin/comment-response.png)
